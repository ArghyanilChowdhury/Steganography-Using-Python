It is a Python-based application that implements 
steganography to conceal secret text messages within digital images. It basically uses the 
Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, which allows users to hide a message within the 
pixels of an image without significantly altering its appearance. Through a user-friendly 
graphical interface built with Tkinter, the application enables users to load an image, input 
a secret message, hide the message in the image, and save the modified image. 
Additionally, the application allows users to retrieve and display hidden messages from 
images.
